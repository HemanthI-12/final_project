Project Introduction:
We are building a ChaCha20 encryption program. A spy will send their intel in the format of a file into the encryption program to encrpyt their super secret information. This encrypted file can later be decrypted by head quarters using the program. This program will ensure that the confidential information makes it safely to the right hands. We choose this project because both of us like cybersecurity topics and found the complexity of encryption algorithms really interesting. So we wanted to do a symmetric encryption that has complex math integrated with it, so through our research online we found CHaCha20. After looking into ChaCha20 and learning more about how the encryption works for data of any length and about 
Goals: 

Please provide a brief description of your project. List the goals and objectives of your project and explain why you’ve chosen to work on this project.
Technical Overview
Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.
Please list what you plan to have finished by each checkpoint. These are meant to be goals to keep your project on track. We will NOT grade your checkpoints on how much you have completed, but on whether or not you’ve made some progress. 
Possible Challenges
Please list some of the challenges you foresee running into.
This can be learning a new crate interface, working with a UI in Rust, etc…
